            Max is a senior Electrical and Computer Engineering student beginning his 3rd year on the team. His interest in robotics began because he kept getting told that more and more workplace
            automation is around the corner, and he wants to be involved in the discussion and practice of replacing human labor with machines and computers. Previously, he served as the electrical
            design sub-team lead and worked on development of the power system. Currently Max leads the team adminstratively and defends the team from the dangers of bureaucracy.

          <p class="people-p">
            Patrick is a senior Mechanical Engineering student beginning his 4th year on the team. He initially joined the team in hopes to gain hands on experience that isnâ€™t taught within the classroom.
            Previously, he served as the mechanical design sub-team lead and worked on development of the drone frame as well as a removable electronics housing. He hopes to lead the team into pushing
            the boundaries of autonomous robotic behaviors while competing in IARC. Currently Patrick heads the finances of the team, making sure we can fund our missions and project endeavors.

            Lukas is a senior Computer Engineering and Computer Science student beginning his 3rd year on the team. Given the chance to apply himself and do something of actual interest, he leap at the chance to
            join the team. Previously, he served as the software design sub-team lead and worked on the development of the visual localization system and autonomous flight for IARC missions 7 and 8. Currently Lukas
            leads the team in techincal task and decides what challenges need immediate attention.
